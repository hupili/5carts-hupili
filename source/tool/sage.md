First checked it out two years ago.
Not very attractive at that time.
The installation package is too large.
When I re visit the site today, there are way too many new cool stuffs.

[sagenb](http://www.sagenb.org/):

   * Online iPython style notebook.

Awesome features from [sage cloud](https://cloud.sagemath.com/):

   * A linux shell for each project.
   * sage installed.
   * Network connection, free to install other software.
   * Online LaTeX editing and compiling.
