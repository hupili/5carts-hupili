[lifesinger](https://github.com/lifesinger/lifesinger.github.com/issues/162)
referred to the 
[Look around tutorial](http://www.regular-expressions.info/lookaround.html)
on this site. 

This tutorial series is well written. 
There are multiple notable features:

   * The notation and page rendering. 
   Unlike a random blog post, the author really did many works in typesetting. 
   e.g. distinguish "pattern" and "string" by colors. 
   All these small typesetting considerations save people's time in parsing the tutorials.
   * The discussion of internal works of RegEx engines. 
   This really helps to avoid some pitfalls in writing RegEx. 
   I personally feel the writing of this part is too verbose
   but it's worth the time. 
   * The discussion of different implementations in different RegEx engines. 

Drawbacks:

   * Verbose description (for non novice users) as I said above. 
   * It had better tabularize some facts for quicker reference. 

My take for this site:

   * It is good as a 2nd course,
   i.e. for those who already got their hands dirty with RegEx.
   * As a 1st course, I think a random tutorial 
   for a language-specific RegEx is better. 
   It gets your work done soon.
   * As a quick reference, one may also consult some language specific documents.
   Those are better indexed or tabularized. 

Between the 1st course and 2nd course, what you need is years of experience. 
It's very important to solve some problems in dirty ways, 
so that you can appreciate the design of RegEx.
Then, it's the time for you to learn the details carefully.
