   * First know it from Wang Yin, who refers to this web service multiple times. 
   e.g. the mindmap for 
   [TeXmacs](http://www.mindomo.com/view?m=b207992c90c046bdbe4053cbdf88b5d5). 
   * When I visited it using FF on Ubuntu, the view jitters quite a lot.
   It's not smooth. 
   When I visit it one year later using Safari on OS X, the UI turns out to be very good. 
   That's how it gets 5/10. 

It looks attractive but the following facts prevent me from using it:

   * It's neither open-source nor open-format web service. 
   The materials created by me is in danger. 
   * Only 3 mindmaps for a free account is too limited.
