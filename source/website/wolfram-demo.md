First know this site (Wolfram Demo) from the Social Computing course (CSCI5070). 
The lecturer showed the 
[degree distribution of random graphs demo](http://demonstrations.wolfram.com/DegreeDistributionOnARandomNetwork/)
.

   * Looks to contain a lot demos. 
   * In a standard format for exchange.
   * Need to install Wolfram's CDF player (200MB+ package; 800MB+ on disk...)
