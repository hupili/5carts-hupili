First know this site (Wolfram Demo) from the Social Computing course (CSCI5070). 
The lecturer showed the 
[degree distribution of random graphs demo](http://demonstrations.wolfram.com/DegreeDistributionOnARandomNetwork/)
.

Advantages:

   * Looks to contain a lot demos. 
   * In a standard format for exchange.

Disadvantages:

   * Need to install Wolfram's CDF player (200MB+ package; 800MB+ on disk...)
   * The demos I'm interested in do not reflect what I want exactly.
   I want to modify it. However.
   No quick guide for me to create such demos?
   Need to install other software to get started (e.g. Mathematica)?
