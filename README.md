A template to write reviews for tools, websites, projects, etc. 

Why
---

   * You try hundreds of new stuffs every year: tools, websites, books, ...
   * How to manage them?
   * How to easily share them?

How
---

   * Use GitHub pages and Jekyll. 
   * Write reviews for all kinds of stuffs
   with structured data (frontmatter of Jekyll pages)
   and unstructured data (lengthy body). 
   * Be able to write under any environment. 
   * Be able to render full pages (like blog posts) 
   and digest with different categorization scheme. 
   * Provide index for easy search.
   * Categorization in a human way (by directory).
   * Output Meta data in XML format (make machine readable information).
   * Use Frontend AJAX to provide rich function.

What
----

   * A Jekyll template. 
   * Tools (shell scripts to call git) for gh-page distribution. 
   * Some sample review pages.
   * AJAX suites to provide rich functions.

Status
------

In the foreseeable future, I would not have much time on this repo. 

   * If you are farmiliar with Jekyll and what I'm pursuing here, 
   I'll be glad to add you as a collaborator. 
   You will be a main driving force. 
   * Welcome to implement it under your own repo. 
   Then I'll link to yours without any hesitate. 
   * If you understand what I'm pursuing but do not know how, 
   I would be happy to discuss with you and provide tech support.

Although the template is not ready,
I will keep on writing notes in another repo.
I feel comfortable with this, because my content is under my own control
and I can distribute them easily at any time.
